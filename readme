DataCamp Associate Data Analyst Certification: PetMind Sales Analysis
This repository contains my submission for the DataCamp Associate Data Analyst Certification exam. The project involves a realistic business case for PetMind, a US-based pet supply retailer, requiring a full analysis of their sales data to derive actionable insights.

Project Overview
Background
PetMind is a pet supply retailer that sells a variety of luxury and everyday products. To drive growth, the company has been testing a new strategy focused on increasing repeat purchases of everyday items. This project analyzes one year of sales data to evaluate the impact of this strategy.

Objective
The primary goal was to analyze the provided dataset and create a report that answers key questions about data integrity, sales distribution, and the relationship between repeat purchases and sales revenue.

The Analysis
The analysis was conducted in four main stages:

1. Data Validation and Cleaning
The first step was to ensure the quality and integrity of the data. For each of the 8 columns in the 1500-record dataset, I performed the following:

Schema Validation: Verified that the data in each column matched the types and constraints described in the data dictionary.

Missing Value Assessment: Identified and quantified the number of missing values in each column.

Data Correction: Documented and executed the necessary steps to clean the data and align it with the provided descriptions, creating a reliable foundation for analysis.

2. Repeat Purchase Distribution
To understand customer behavior, I created a visualization to illustrate the frequency of repeat purchases. This visualization helped to:

Identify which category (repeat or not) contained the most observations.

Assess whether the dataset was balanced or imbalanced concerning repeat purchases, a crucial consideration for any further modeling or analysis.

3. Sales Distribution Analysis
I generated a visualization to describe the overall distribution of sales. This analysis answered questions such as:

What is the typical sales amount?

Are sales skewed towards lower or higher values?

Are there any significant outliers in the sales data?

4. Relationship Between Repeat Purchases and Sales
Finally, I created a visualization to explore the core business question: the relationship between repeat purchases and sales. This visualization directly demonstrates whether customers who make repeat purchases tend to have different sales values compared to those who do not, providing a clear, data-driven answer to PetMind's strategic question.

Key Skills Demonstrated
Data Cleaning and Validation: Identifying inconsistencies, handling missing data, and ensuring data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using descriptive statistics and visualizations to summarize key characteristics of the data.

Data Visualization: Creating clear and effective charts (e.g., bar charts, histograms, box plots) in Python or R to communicate findings.

Statistical Interpretation: Analyzing distributions and relationships between variables to extract meaningful business insights.
